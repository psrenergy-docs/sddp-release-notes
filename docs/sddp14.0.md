## New Features and Improvements

* Model
  * new option for load shedding in buses: "none"
  * new output reports related to fuel reservoir:
    * marginal value of fuel in reservoir
    * marginal value of fuel reservoir capacity
  * added type (existing/future) for DC links
  * evaporation effect on hydro plants is now considered since the beginning of the
    dead storage fill-up (if considered)
  * new option to consider at least one loss linearization for all circuits, which may be necessary
    to ensure differentiation between the marginal costs on the terminal buses of circuits with low losses.
    This option may increase the computational time and should be used only when necessary.
  * removed the limitation of 20 processes per computer in parallel execution
  * update Xpress optimization solver to version 7.9 to improve numerical stability in some cases
* GUI
  * new field for the definition of fixed penalty for the flood control energy constraint
    of joint reservoir constraints
  * increased the precision of fixed duration of blocks data to avoid round problems in the sum
  * new feature to adapt interface to computer's regional settings
  * new option to import initial storage file in binary format in the
    "Economic dispath > Solution strategy > Initial storages" option
  * new column describing the type of generation constraint: lower or upper limit
  * new column describing fuel contract type: free contract or integral contract
* Hydrology > Parameter estimation
  * report improvement for the estimation of hydro sites with constant intermediate inflows
  * added tolerance for stationarity tests
* Dashboard
  * the chart's style has been updated to a much fancier style: check it out!
* Power View
  * improvements in the responsiveness of map control options such as zoom, scroll, panning.

## Fixed Bugs

* Model
  * possible error in the identification algorithm of excess in renewable generation
    in cases with the representation of the transmission network
  * wrong definition of the type of aggregation per block for the CO2 emission cost outputs
  * possible error in the execution of the model in Windows Server 2012 and Windows XP
  * possible error in cases with excess in renewable generation for relatively large datasets
  * error for parallel execution of cases with spaces in path
* GUI
  * error in the visualization of operative costs for cases with specific consumption
    varying per block
  * error while saving the lower and upper limits for sum of interconnections
  * error while saving load per bus configuration data file with more
    than 32,768 records
  * error while loading fuel contract data with initial date separated by dots instead of slashes
  * error in the copy to Excel function of renewable source scenarios data
  * error activating the use of climatic variables in the inflows
  * error saving bus configuration data after deleting a power plant
  * error saving the climatic variable option
* Graph
  * update to version 2.3
  * problem for cases using binary output and csv (specific case when running SDDP
    with OptGen model)
* Power View
  * error representing the circuit capacities over time. For some particular cases, the exhibited capacity
    did not match with circuit data.
  * error representing existing and future circuits in weekly studies

## New Features and Improvements

* Model
  * new options for monitoring of circuit limits: "tie-lines only" and "none"
  * new output: stored energy at a storage level of 65% of the useful storage
* GUI
  * incremental search filter on bus geographical location screen
  * verification for circuit emergency limit lower than normal limit

## Fixed Bugs
