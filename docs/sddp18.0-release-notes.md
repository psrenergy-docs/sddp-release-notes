# SDDP 18.0 ‚Äì Integrated Energy System Planning Platform

üìù For the detailed changelog and download links, please visit [this page](sddp18.0-changelog.md).

## üöÄ Unified platform for integrated energy system planning

**SDDP 18.0 consolidates operation, expansion, maintenance, and reliability planning into a single integrated platform** ‚Äî offering a seamless experience with shared data, consistent modeling structures, and a unified execution environment.

This release introduces a redesigned interface, powerful new modeling capabilities, and advanced automation tools to support high-resolution studies across technologies and planning horizons.

From energy storage and efficiency programs to security-constrained dispatch, generation and network expansion, and integrated energy supply chains ‚Äî SDDP 18.0 supports a streamlined workflow for building, executing, and analyzing complex studies with technical consistency and full transparency.

SDDP 18.0 brings to energy system planning the full capabilities of PSR‚Äôs mathematical optimization engine ‚Äî designed and continuously enhanced over decades to address real-world challenges. At its core is our Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm, originally developed by PSR and recognized as the state-of-the-art approach for modeling intertemporal decision-making under uncertainty, particularly those involving storage, flexibility, and multi-stage planning.

This methodology is now applied across all segments of the energy sector ‚Äî including electricity, water, natural gas, hydrogen, biomass, and other integrated supply chains ‚Äî all of which can be jointly modeled and co-optimized within a unified decision framework that supports large-scale studies with rigorous stochastic representation.

## üî∑ Graphical interface and user experience

## üìÅ Data compatibility and migration

SDDP 18.0 introduces a redesigned data architecture that enhances consistency, scalability, and integration across the entire platform.

- Internal structure unified across all models, consolidating configuration, execution, and results under a single framework  
- Several legacy input formats and files have been discontinued; dedicated migration tools and compatibility checks assist users during the transition  
- Complete redesign of the **transmission network data structure**, enabling more detailed and robust modeling  
- New support for **reactive power input fields**, facilitating integration with  power flow and grid analysis tools  
- The previous limitation of **5-digit codes** and **12-character names** for network elements has been eliminated, allowing for more descriptive and standardized naming  
- **Migration of existing data** will be triggered automatically when the case is opened through the interface for the first time  
- **Improved scenario loading behavior**: scenario-based data (e.g., injections, renewables) are now stored in a fast direct-access format, allowing the interface to load only the relevant data for the selected agent or system. This avoids unnecessary pre-loading and significantly improves performance in large models.  
- Although the initial **conversion to single-bin format** may take slightly longer ‚Äî as it performs a more robust and complete transformation ‚Äî this process occurs only once per study. Subsequent interactions benefit from faster screen loading and smoother navigation.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The updated data format is **not compatible** with earlier SDDP versions. It is strongly recommended to create and store a backup copy of your project files before using version 18.0 if you intend to maintain compatibility with previous releases.
