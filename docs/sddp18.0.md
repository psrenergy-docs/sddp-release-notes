## ‚ö° Energy system modeling

### üîó Energy supply chains

Detailed modeling of energy supply chains, enabling integrated planning of electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, biomass, Power-to-X, X-to-Y, and more.

- **Comprehensive supply chain modeling**: represent the full cycle of energy transformation, including production, transport, conversion, storage, and demand.
- **Multiple energy carriers**: define energy networks for fuels such as natural gas, hydrogen, methanol, biogas, electricity, and synthetic products.
- **System-wide integration**: energy supply chains are directly linked to the power system through converters, fuel-consuming units, and electrification modules.
- **Element types**:
  - **Producers** (e.g., gas wells, steam reformers, anaerobic digesters)
  - **Converters** (e.g., electrolyzers, methanol synthesis, biogas purifiers)
  - **Storage facilities** (e.g., hydrogen tanks, gas cylinders, long-term storage)
  - **Transport links** between nodes with capacity, cost, and losses
  - **Demands**, elastic or inelastic, at any node in the chain
- **Applications**:
  - **Natural gas**: from gas wells to thermal plants and households via pipelines and storage
  - **Hydrogen**: production from electrolysis or reforming; distribution and use in vehicles or industry
  - **Biomass**: conversion to biogas, biomethane, and electricity, with links to transport and heat sectors
  - **Power-to-X and X-to-Y**: enabling sector coupling between power, mobility, heat, and synthetic fuels

### üí° Energy efficiency

Modeling of energy efficiency programs as investment decisions that reduce or reshape energy demand across the system.

- **Explicit representation of efficiency programs**: each program is linked to a specific demand class and represents an improvement that reduces energy consumption.
- **Flexible modeling structure**:
  - Allows modeling demand reductions across different time resolutions, reflecting seasonal or intraday efficiency impacts.
  - Supports varying levels of efficiency adoption over time, enabling the representation of progressive program deployment.
- **Endogenous investment decisions**: the level of deployment can be optimized considering cost-effectiveness in both **operation** and **expansion** planning.
- **Typical applications** include more efficient lighting in public infrastructure, industrial equipment retrofits, and residential upgrades such as improved air conditioning or heating systems.
- **Expansion planning integration**: efficiency programs are treated as investment alternatives with costs, constraints, and impacts on system needs ‚Äî alongside traditional generation and transmission projects.

<!-- ### üîÄ Hybrid chronology

- Combines **typical days and chronological blocks** in a single run.
- Enables short-term modeling of renewable variability and intraday storage cycles while preserving computational efficiency. -->

## üèóÔ∏è Expansion planning

### üìà Efficient frontier analysis

- **Multi-criteria optimization** to identify portfolios that minimize cost while managing risk in expansion planning.
- Allows decision-makers to explore the trade-off between total cost and risk, selecting robust and cost-effective energy mixes.
- Accounts for uncertainty sources like fuel prices, climate variability, and policy shifts.
- Compatible with complex system interdependencies, including **energy supply chains and technology interactions**.
- Supports the **visualization of optimal and sub-optimal portfolios**, enhancing understanding of planning alternatives.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance planning

Enables the **explicit and high-resolution modeling of maintenance schedules**, allowing users to move beyond simplified capacity derating and achieve more accurate planning results.

- Particularly valuable in contexts where **hourly dynamics and short-term constraints** matter for both operation and expansion planning‚Äîhelping avoid distortions caused by average availability assumptions.
- Also supports **system operators and coordination agents** in approving, aggregating, or rescheduling maintenance requests under reliability and feasibility criteria.
- Maximizes the **system reserve margin** by identifying and protecting the most critical periods using risk-based metrics.
- Captures key operational constraints, including **minimum up/down times**, **ramp limits**, **precedence and association between maintenance requests**, **non-coincident maintenance** rules, and **forbidden periods or priority preferences**.
- Fully integrated into the broader planning methodology, complementing **operation planning with SDDP** and **expansion planning with OptGen**.

## üóº Transmission representation

A detailed transmission model is essential for accurately representing key aspects of modern energy systems ‚Äî such as renewable integration, curtailment management, and operational flexibility. This enhanced modeling capability supports both operation and expansion planning with a high level of electrical and spatial granularity.

- Supports a wide range of **AC and DC components**: lines, 2- and 3-winding transformers, LCC and VSC converters, shunt devices, SVCs, and synchronous compensators  
- Includes advanced attributes such as electrical parameters, flow capacities, fault probabilities, tap settings, and voltage/reactive power control  
- Represents corridor constraints, contingency conditions, and flexible network topologies  
- Compatible with standard power flow databases and allows import from **PSS¬ÆE**, **PSLF**, and **other formats**

<!-- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling improvements
